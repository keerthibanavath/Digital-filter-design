Design the Filter:

First, you decide what kind of filter you want (for example, low-pass to remove high frequencies).

You calculate a set of numbers called coefficients. These numbers determine how the filter behaves.

This step is usually done using software like MATLAB, which has built-in tools to generate the coefficients.

Implement the Filter:

You apply the filter to a signal by multiplying each input value by a coefficient and then adding the results.

In MATLAB, this is done using simple commands.

In Verilog, which is used for hardware design, you write code that mimics this behavior using shift registers and multipliers.

Simulate the Filter:

Simulation means testing the filter using example input signals.

In MATLAB, you can plot the filtered output and see how it changes.

In Verilog, you create a testbench and simulate the design using a tool like ModelSim to view waveforms.
